Here's a story about awakening.

Doctor's order: 4 weeks of complete rest. A video from Jim Rohn. From drifting in life to taking control, from indecision to picking a path, from self-doubting to confidence, from worrying to handling problems, from over-cautious to wisdom, from pessimist to optimist, from complaining to taking action.

Life is all about enjoying everything that the world throws at you. There will be happiness and sadness; handle it. One rule of thumb: "Do not miss anything", every experience brings in more life.

Here are some steps I have taken
1. Taking control is the same as being conscious of what you are doing. Ask yourself, are you letting things be as they are? It's time to ask yourself what you want to do and pour in whatever you have onto it.
2. Making a decision is tough because we worry about its results. Be it any matter, we have to decide one way or the other. If the decision is wrong, handle it; if it's right, enjoy it.
3. As we drift, we doubt ourselves. Are we still that person who can do anything, or have we accepted that we have lost our way? We are what we think we are, rather than what we really are. Be a believer, you can do it.
4. Worrying is the most useless way to spend your time. It's a useless state. Even if life is difficult and challenging, worrying doesn't provide the solution. Feeling worried, try letting it go and continue with what you feel is right, and handle the rest.
5. We start as being cautious, and then we somehow land being over-cautious. Over-caution comes from a thought of scarcity and insecurity. It is asking the question, what if I don't have enough? What if I do this and this and it falls apart? Think from a mindset of abundance, enough time, enough money, enough energy to live a life to the fullest. If you can recover from the loss, then why be over-cautious?
6. Pessimism is finding reasons not to do. There can be 100 excuses to not do an activity, but we need only one reason to do it. It's up to us to decide whether we want it or not, the reason follows. What we think we are, so we become. 
7. Complaining, crying, and whining don't do us any good. Take action instead of complaining. What can you act on to change the current state? Build on it, bring in more support for your cause. Action leads to results. Action is taking control of your fate; complaining lets others control your fate.
