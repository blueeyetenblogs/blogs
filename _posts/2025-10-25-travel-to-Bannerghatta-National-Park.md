Here's a way to enjoy your weekend

We went for a weekend outing to Bannerghatta National Park. In techie terminology, it was a seamless experience.

Book tickets using this [link](https://etickets.bannerughattabiopark.org/bookingticket). We booked the AC Bus Safari Combo. Reached there before time, went through the ticket checking counter, was seated in a covered area and boarded bus in under 15 min. The place was well maintained, clean, enough car parking, and with enough amenities required for a great travel experience. The bus was good, the sights were awesome. My wife created the following video for keeping this memory.
