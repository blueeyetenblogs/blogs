I had 2 instances with Bengaluru Taxi Drivers both time I did something differently. One was a mess and the other a lesson.

## 1st instance
In Bengaluru traffic, cars bumper to bumper, no lane concept for any car. I was moving along the rightmost lane when a taxi car moved right trying to squeeze me. Moving at my pace thinking he won't move in closer, he might have thought I would stop. I hit his right mirror with my mirror, my mirror closed, thinking it was minor I moved forward. There was loud honking behind me by the driver. He wanted to overtake me and show his dominance(I think this is the right word for him). He stopped in front of me, I thought he would get down to beat me but he just wanted to slow me down. I didn't move and other cars started honking, then he moved and again stopped, I did the same, other cars honked. In truth, I am constantly worried when I stay in Bengaluru, so much pressure from many sides, it was worst after his circus. Anyway since he didn't get any reply from me he left.

## 2nd instance
In Bengaluru traffic again, same to same(we live our life in traffic). The only difference this time I was in the middle lane. Taxi came to squeeze me(I still don't know what they try to achieve with this, there is no space forward, where is he going? Maybe he needs more runway to fly). I hit this guys mirror, again with the honking. This time I was in Zen mode, I had decided there was no point in worrying. As he came side to side with me, I turned, crossed my arms as in namaste pose and bowed as if sorry. This time the driver smiled and showed action that I can go.

I guess it's true, "what we think of the reality as" dictates more than "what the actual reality is". For a good number of times we can decide whether a bad experience affects us or not based how we take it in. One instance was too much to handle because I was not ready to handle it and the other I had decided I can handle it.
